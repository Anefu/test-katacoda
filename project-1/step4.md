# Viewing Contents of a File
### cat Command
**cat** spits the contents of a file onto your terminal.  
`cat lorem`{{execute}}  
  
### head
Outputs the first 10 lines of a file.  
`head lorem`{{execute}}  
  
### tail
Opposite of tail (obviously huh?). Outputs the last ten lines of a file.  
`tail lorem`{{execute}}

### more
Spits contents of a file in bits, allowing you to scroll through the contents in consummable portions. Particularly handy for going through a large file with hundreds of lines.  
`more lorem`{{execute}}  
  
### less
Does the exact thing with **more**, but starts out with **less** number of lines.  
`less lorem`{{execute}}
