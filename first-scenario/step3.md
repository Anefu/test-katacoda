# Files and Filesystem Cont'd
### mv Command
You've come across the **mv** command from Step 1. It renames files basically, but can also be used to move files and directories (cut and paste)  
Some new files have been created, check them out.  
We'll move some of them to the pbl directory.  
  
`mv file1 pbl/`{{execute}}  
Or to rename a file  
`mv file2 darey2`{{execute}}
  
### The rm Command
The **rm** command (remove) is used to delete files, directories or any object that exists on your system.  
  
`rm file3`{{execute}}
  
To remove directories:  
  
`rm -rf darey.io`{{execute}}  
The **-r** tells to rm command to delete recursively (delete the contents in the directory) and **-f** forces the deletion.
